Flash Attention has emerged as a breakthrough method for efficient attention computation in transformer models, reducing memory complexity from O(n²) to O(n) through clever tiling and recomputation strategies. However, there remain opportunities for further optimization, particularly in the areas of tile size selection, memory access patterns, and parallel computation scheduling.

This research aims to develop an enhanced version of Flash Attention that focuses on three key areas: adaptive tiling strategies that respond to input characteristics, improved memory locality through cache-aware algorithms, and optimized parallel execution patterns for modern GPU architectures. The proposed improvements will target both inference and training scenarios.

The project will incorporate recent advances in hardware-specific optimization techniques and automated performance tuning to create a more efficient attention mechanism that can be readily integrated into existing transformer architectures.
